Emily: Merry Christmas!
Rich: …who sent you?
@SFX(SURPRISE)

Emily: I’m...sorry? Nobody sent me. 
Rich: What? 
Emily: No, I just...wanted to stop by and wish you a Merry Christmas and-

@SFX(ANGRY)

Rich: Huh. You think I’ll fall for that?

@SFX(SURPRISE)

Emily: Wait! Nobody sent me! I just...I thought I’d...you know...spread a little Christmas cheer 
Emily: and also...get to know my Richs a bit better. 
Rich: Is that...code for something?
Emily: No! 
Rich: ...alright. BUT! I’ve got my eye on you. You try anything funny-
Emily: N-no, of course not. 

@SFX(DOOR_CLOSE)
Emily: [enters house]

@SFX(SURPRISE)
Emily: Oh...I...like your decorations. The usual...tree and stuff are...heh...overrated, anyway.
Rich: This isn’t a decoration! Tell me, friend...how much do you know about...aliens? 

@SFX(SURPRISE)
Emily: Uh...not a whole lot, to be honest.
Rich: Figures. The common man is kept in the dark about the truth about extraterrestrial life,
Rich: how much they permeate our day to day life. How-

@SFX(SURPRISE)
Emily: N-not to interrupt but...since you are...enlightening me about this, could I have some coffee or something? 
Emily: It’s pretty cold outside. 
Rich: Oh, sure. You’ll need to be sitting down for all of this. 

Rich: [Exits and re-enters with coffee mug]

Emily: Oh, thank you.
Rich: Now then, prepare for your mind to be BLOWN.

@EVENT_OVERLAY (Two Hours Later...)

Rich: ...hosting alien embryos UNWILLING and then-
Emily: No, it’s...okay. I get the picture. Wow. That was...eye-opening. 
Rich: Well, I feel like I maybe gave you a little TOO much on your first exploration of alien-human relations.

@SFX(SURPRISE)
Emily: Oh no, I think I’m good on… ”relations” of that kind. But thanks anyway. 
Rich: No problem. Just once I started, I could not stop, you know?! 
Rich: EVERYONE needs to know this but like...not everyone is capable of REALLY understanding it, you know? 
Rich: Most people are just so stuck in their complacent little lives to really look for the ANSWERS. 
Emily: No, I understand. It’s...too...uh...RADICAL for-
Rich: Exactly! Could you imagine if people knew the last six presidents were aliens in human bio-disguise? 
Rich: Very definition of ‘radical’, my friend. 
Emily: Yeah, definitely. Well, I should get going but I wanted to drop this off for you. Merry Christmas. 

Emily: [Hands over present]

Rich: …
Emily: um...OH, don’t worry. There’s not a growth pod in there, like... like you talked about before. Hah. 

@SFX(SURPRISE)
Rich: You got this for me? 
Emily: Yeah, of course. 
Rich: Why?
Emily: I just...like I said, I wanted to get to know my Richs a bit better and spread a little...Christmas cheer… 
Emily: Not in the form of terraforming acid spores, again...l-like you said-
Rich: ...oh. That’s...nice of you. 
Emily: Thanks. ‘Tis the season and all that. 
Rich: ...can I...open it now?
Emily: Oh, no. Go ahead. 

@SFX(UNWRAP)

Rich: …
Emily: OH. I’m sorry. Is it too-?

@SFX(HAPPY)

Rich: I... LOVE IT! 
Emily: You do?
Rich: Yeah, man! You kidding me? I love Greys! 
Emily: ‘Greys’?
Rich: Yeah, the aliens with the triangular shaped heads and the black eyes. First species to land in Roswell. 
Rich: But yeah...this is...really nice. Thanks. 

@SFX(HAPPY)

Emily: No problem. Well...I should get going. Don't want to eat up too much of your time.

Emily: [Starts to leave]

Rich: Hey. 
Emily: Yeah?
Rich: ...thanks...for...coming by. Not a lot of people...come to visit me. @SFX(SAD)
Emily: It's no trouble at all. It's not much, but-
Rich: No, it's...more than enough. Even just...talking to someone. It's...nice. 
Rich: My ideas can be too radical for a lot of folks so I don't have a lot of people I talk to irl.
Emily: Oh, you mean in person?
Rich: Yeah. But... this was nice. 

@SFX(HAPPY)

Rich: We should do it again sometime. 

@SFX(HAPPY)
Emily: Definitely. Merry Christmas
Rich: Merry Christmas to you too.

Emily: [Exits house]
