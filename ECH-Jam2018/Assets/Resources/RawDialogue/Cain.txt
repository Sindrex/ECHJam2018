Cain: Hey, neighbor! What are you doing out so late in the snow?
Emily: Me? Just talking a walk and wanted to pay some neighbors a visit on Christmas. 
Emily: This is for you. [hands over present]
@SFX(HAPPY)
Cain: Oh, thank you! 
@SFX(SAD)
Cain: Oh, but I don't have anything for you in return. 
Cain: Ummm...I've got some candy canes left. You want a candy cane? 
Emily: Hahah. No, I'm good. I just wanted to swing by. 
Cain: Suit yourself. Don't stay out too long, alright? It might not stop snowing until tomorrow morning. 
Emily: Okay, I will. 
@SFX(HAPPY)
Cain: Don't be a stranger. Merry Christmas.
Emily: Merry Christmas to you, too!
